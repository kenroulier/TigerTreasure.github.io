**Game Specifications: **

Game Objective: 
 - The game can be of any theme, but its mechanics must be simple to understand and engage with.  
 - It should be designed such that one person controls the game, while others interact verbally or through other non-direct control means. 

Platform: 
 - The Tiger Treasure Hunt is written in REACT and deployed via the [Tiger](https://github.com/kenroulier/TigerTreasure.github.io) Public GitHub Repository using GitHub Pages.  Initial iterations where done using standard HTML/Index/CSS and Javascript to call external public APIs.  In the end it was determined to be easier to use REACT to accomplish the same results.

Technology and Libraries: 
 - You may utilize any game development frameworks or libraries such as Phaser, Unity (WebGL), or P5.js. 
 - Integration of third-party APIs is encouraged if they enhance the game experience. 
   - Any code or assets that are not original must be properly attributed.
